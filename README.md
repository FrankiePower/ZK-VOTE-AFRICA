# zk-Vote-Africa: Decentralized Electoral System on Lisk Blockchain
## Overview
### Problem Statement
Electoral processes, especially in many African countries, face significant challenges, including vote tampering, lack of transparency, disenfranchisement of diaspora voters, and inefficiencies in voter registration and result collation. These issues often undermine the democratic process and erode public trust in electoral outcomes.

### Solution
Our solution is a decentralized electoral system built on the Lisk blockchain. This system ensures transparency, security, and efficiency in electoral processes by leveraging smart contracts, decentralized storage, and blockchain technology. The system allows for secure voter registration, transparent vote casting, accurate result collation, and the inclusion of diaspora voters. Additionally, zk-SNARKs technology is used to anonymize casted votes, ensuring voter privacy.

## Key Features
- Voter Registration: A secure and decentralized process for registering eligible voters, storing their data on IPFS/Pinata, and ensuring each voter is uniquely identified.
- Vote Casting: A transparent and tamper-proof mechanism for casting votes, with zk-SNARKs used to anonymize votes.
- Result Collation: Accurate and verifiable collation of votes, with results being publicly accessible and immutable.
- Diaspora Voting: Inclusion of diaspora voters, allowing them to securely participate in the electoral process from anywhere in the world.

## Technology Stack
### Backend:

- Lisk Blockchain: Used for deploying smart contracts that manage voter registration, vote casting, and result collation.
- IPFS/Pinata: Utilized for decentralized storage of voter data, ensuring that sensitive information is securely stored and easily retrievable.

### Frontend:

- React.js: A powerful JavaScript library used for building the user interface of the decentralized application (dApp).
- Wagmi: A collection of React hooks that simplifies interactions with Ethereum and other EVM-compatible blockchains, including Lisk.
- Web3.js: A library that allows the dApp to interact with the Lisk blockchain and smart contracts, enabling functionalities like wallet connections, transactions, and data fetching.

## Our Approach
### Phase 1: Problem Definition and Requirements Gathering
- Objective: Identify and understand the key issues in the current electoral systems, particularly in African countries.
- Approach:
    - Conduct research and gather insights from stakeholders in the electoral process.
    - Define the requirements for the decentralized electoral system, including voter registration, vote casting, result collation, and diaspora voting.
    - Design the system architecture and create UI/UX wireframes.
### Phase 2: Smart Contract Development
- Objective: Develop smart contracts that ensure secure, transparent, and efficient management of voter registration, voting, and result collation.
- Approach:
    - Develop the Voter Registration Contract to handle the decentralized registration of voters.
    - Implement the Voting Contract to securely manage vote casting, ensuring each vote is recorded and counted transparently.
    - Create the Collation Contract to aggregate and finalize voting results, ensuring the integrity and accuracy of the electoral outcomes.
    - Use zk-SNARKs for anonymizing casted votes, protecting voter privacy.
    - Deploy and test the smart contracts on the Lisk testnet before deploying to the mainnet.
### Phase 3: Frontend Development
- Objective: Build a user-friendly interface that allows voters and election officials to interact with the blockchain.
- Approach:
    - Develop the frontend using React.js, focusing on usability and accessibility.
    - Integrate Wagmi for managing blockchain interactions and wallet connections.
    - Use Web3.js to connect the frontend with the smart contracts deployed on the Lisk blockchain.
    - Implement user flows for voter registration, vote casting, and result viewing.
### Phase 4: IPFS/Pinata Integration
- Objective: Securely store and manage voter data using decentralized storage.
- Approach:
    - Integrate IPFS/Pinata with the smart contracts and frontend.
    - Store voter data on IPFS/Pinata, ensuring it is secure, immutable, and decentralized.
    - Retrieve and display stored voter data within the dApp as needed, ensuring data integrity.
### Phase 5: Testing, Security Audit, and Deployment
- Objective: Ensure the system is secure, reliable, and ready for deployment.
- Approach:
    - Conduct thorough testing, including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
    - Perform a security audit on the smart contracts and the overall system to identify and fix vulnerabilities.
    - Deploy the smart contracts on the Lisk mainnet and launch the frontend application on a cloud service or decentralized hosting.
### Phase 6: Maintenance and Future Enhancements
- Objective: Continuously improve the system and add new features based on feedback and evolving needs.
- Approach:
    - Monitor the system performance and security post-launch.
    - Implement additional features, such as real-time analytics, multi-language support, and enhanced user experience.
    - Plan for scaling the system to support larger elections or different regions.
