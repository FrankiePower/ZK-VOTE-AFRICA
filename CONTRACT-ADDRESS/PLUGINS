Namespace ENS Web3 Plugin Integration

In our project, we have integrated the Namespace ENS Web3 Plugin to extend our Web3 capabilities for managing ENS domains. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of how we implemented and used the plugin:

Plugin Setup:

We initialized the Web3 instance with either a public connection (such as MetaMask) or a private RPC URL. For private connections, we also added our private key to the Web3 wallet.
The ENS Plugin was registered with Web3, specifying the appropriate Ethereum chain (Sepolia or Mainnet) to use the ENS functionalities.
Getting an Address:

We utilized the plugin to resolve and retrieve the Ethereum address associated with a given ENS domain name. This allows us to look up which address a specific ENS name resolves to.
Setting and Getting Text Records:

We set up and managed text records for ENS domains. This involves adding or updating key-value pairs of text records for a domain. We also have the capability to remove specific records as needed.
To retrieve text records, we queried the ENS domain for specific keys, allowing us to access the stored values associated with those keys.
This implementation enables efficient management of ENS names, addresses, and text records within our Web3 project.
